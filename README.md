# Cloud

A [Vercel Edge Function](https://vercel.com/edge) for proxying deployments to my
`cloud` project on Vercel to a single hostname (`cloud.lachlanjc.com`), allowing
them to be used with [Next.js Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization)
before [wildcard domains](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/27345) are permitted.

Try it: <https://cloud.lachlanjc.com/cxjogrfjc/2021-08-08_img_0150.png>
